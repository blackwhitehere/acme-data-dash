# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are an expert AI programming assistant working on the `acme-rust-template` project, a template for Rust projects.

## General Guidelines

- **Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Always adhere to the guidelines specified in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). This is your primary source of truth for development workflows and standards.
- **Rust Idioms**: Write idiomatic Rust code. Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/style-team).
- **Performance**: This is a performance-sensitive tool.
    - Use `rayon` for parallel processing where appropriate.
    - Minimize allocations and I/O operations.
- **Safety**: Prefer safe Rust. Only use `unsafe` if absolutely necessary and strictly documented.

## Development Workflow

When generating code or suggesting changes, ensure they comply with the project's workflow:

1.  **Formatting**: Code must be formatted with `cargo fmt`.
2.  **Linting**: Code must pass `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
3.  **Testing**:
    - Add unit tests for new logic in the same file (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
    - Add integration tests in `tests/` if needed.
    - Ensure `cargo test --all-features` passes.

## Project Structure

- `src/lib.rs`: Library entry point.
- `src/main.rs`: CLI entry point.
- `benches/`: Benchmarks using `criterion`.

## Changelog

When making changes to the project, update `CHANGELOG.md` to document the changes:

1.  **Add entries under `[Unreleased]`**: All changes should be added under the `[Unreleased]` section at the top of the changelog.
2.  **Use the correct category**: Group changes under the appropriate heading:
    - `Added` for new features.
    - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
    - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
    - `Removed` for now removed features.
    - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
    - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
    - `Performance` for performance improvements.
3.  **Write clear descriptions**: Each entry should be a concise, human-readable description of the change.
4.  **Reference issues/PRs**: When applicable, reference related issues or pull requests.

See [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for more details on the format.

## Commit Messages

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`.
